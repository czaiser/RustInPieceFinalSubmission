# Rust In Piece Final Submission - April 2015
##IM 411 Interactive Studio 

My final submission for assignment 4.
I added some enemies to the game which you can jump on and kill. I also changed the music.

#Moving forward

I plan on working on this further during the summer. My plan includes:

* Refine character animation (hero)
* Add dragonbones for enemy
* Make batteries spin (animation)
* Add a launch screen (with play and menu options)
* Additional levels (level manager in Flash Builder/Citrus Engine)
* Health metre/counter (lose hearts when hit by enemy)
